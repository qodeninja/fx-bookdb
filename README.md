`bookdb` is a pretty neat CLI tool for managing and sharing state across disparate tools via an ultra-light `sqlite` interface. It provides a low level, namespaced key-value store for your scripts and operations by abstracting cumbersome SQL queries into powerful CLI and automation friendly commmands, via the quantum magic of delicious *Context Chains*. ü§å

Think of it as a system registry hive or a simple NoSQL database made with ~~duck~~ duct tape and sticks by a recovering hipster imitating the intricate dance of a beaver that tortures itself by making skyscrapers out of impossible materials like Spandex.

This is a test, but also a rare work of art in tool form dripping with my vibe, so says my resident parser. This my friend is *junkyard engineering* made of metaphoric spare discarded parts.

## üì¶ Core Features

1.   **Persistent Storage:** Your data is squirreled away ~~stored~~ in a `sqlite3` database, surviving reboots, new shell sessions, and dare I say the rapture.

2.   **Hierarchical Namespaces:** Organize your variables into `Projects` and `Key-Value Stores` to prevent conflict between angry applications using baseball bats as greeting wands.
3.  **Context-Aware "Cursor":** Set your active context once and all subsequent commands run within that namespace, just like being ~~sent to bed with no supper~~ `cd`-ed into a directory.
4.  **Powerful I/O:** Easily `import` and `export` variables from standard `.env` files, enabling seamless integration with other tools and powerful migration paths that lead to world domination.
5.   **Hot File Publishing:** Surgically `publish` or `unpublish` individual key-value pairs to and from external configuration files with a sassy flip of your hair.
6.   **Atomic Counters:** Toss `increment` and `decrement` numerical values at the databeez to keep it guessing.
7.  **Automated Installation & Safety:** A smart installer that configures your shell environment, plus automatic daily backups to protect your ~~doodles~~ data.
8.  **Clean CLI Interface:** All SQL complexity is abstracted away into simple, intuitive commands like `getv`, `setv`, and `find` and `zorp`. JK dont use `zorp`. ZORP IS NOT A COMMAND GUYS!



## ‚ö°BashFX Principles 
On a more 9-to-5 note, `bookdb` is built according to a set principles called **BashFX**, designed to make shell tools powerful without being rude. 

For you as a user, this means:

*   **Self-Contained:** All installation artifacts (the database, config files, etc.) live inside a single standardized root directory: `~/.local`.
*   **Invisible:** `bookdb` will never create new dotfiles (`.bookdb`, etc.) in your `$HOME` directory or  pollute your home with anything it generates. It keeps its mess in its own room.
*   **Rewindable:** The automated `install` has an equally automated counterpart. The `reset` command will fully uninstall `bookdb`, removing the script, all data, and its entry from your shell profile. *Most* commands have a rewindable counterpart.
*   **Friendly:** The tool should be proactive in communicating its state. Commands like `status` and `cursor`, and the use of clear log messages, are designed to keep you informed.



## ü§îRequirements

`bookdb` features a ~~fiendish~~ friendly, interactive installer that handles everything for you... *except* your sqlite3 installation and how you might feel about that.

### Prerequisite: Install `sqlite3`

You should have `sqlite3` installed and available in your `PATH`. You can check this by running `command -v sqlite3`. If you've never used it before, dont worry it's *pretty* lighweight and defacto on many systems.  

If it's not found, here's how to install it on common systems:

*   **On Debian/Ubuntu:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install sqlite3
    ```
*   **On Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora:**
    ```bash
    sudo yum install sqlite
    # Or, on modern Fedora:
    sudo dnf install sqlite3
    ```
*   **On macOS (with Homebrew):**
    ```bash
    brew install sqlite
    ```
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Beta Version

  Generally, Debian-based distros with Bash 3.2+ or higher are supported, since direct manual tests of each MVP phase passed without errors, e.g. "works on my machine."
  
  Hypothetically any Bash 3.2+ environment might be compatible; except where certain command idioms differ by OS or implementation. `sed` is a usual suspect among others. 

  **Help Us Cure Works-On-My-Machine Syndrome** and bring wider support to more folks by testing it on your system(s). 

  As a self-contained script `bookdb` wont evil-mangle your stuff, so if you're willing to give er a go, and see what blows in an effort to determine cross-system support, that contribution is most welcome!

  **Assume every new untested tool may cause unforeseen issues, and make sure your data/system state is recoverable before using!**

  Having said that, if you accept these risks and limitations, we get the deeds did and the databeez ~~fid~~ fed.




## ü™úInstallation
## BookDB Installer

**1. Get the Repo.**

Generally, `bookdb` is such a flirt that it'll try to install itself whenever it detects an anomoly in its reality anchors (dont worry, wont clobber); barring that you can install as follows:


```bash
# 1. Get the project repo. Duh. You cant databeez stuff without it. unless your a wizard.
git clone https://github.com/qodeninja/bookdb.git
cd bookdb

# 2. Run the interactive interactor. You're a lizard Larry!
./bookdb install
```

**2. What that button do?**

The installer will:
1.  Explain the actions it will take (creating directories, copying the script to `~/.local/bin/`, etc.).
2.  Intelligently detect your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `.profile`, ~~`~/.zshrc`~~, etc.). 
3.  Ask for your confirmation before making any changes.

Once you grudginly approve the injection of a powerful alien tool into your unsuspecting system, it will automatically configure your ~~soul~~ shell to do what it ~~wants~~ does best. Adventure seekers among us can alternatively avoid all the fluff and fatigue with a well placed `-y` flag for a good time.

**3. Restart Your ~~Soul~~ Shell**

To complete the ~~assimilation~~ installation, start a new shell session or run `source ~/.bashrc` (or your appropriate profile file). The `bookdb` command will now be available everywhere.

üëÅÔ∏è Note: once you've installed `bookdb` into your system  you wont have to use the `./` invoker anymore.
```bash
# Call me anytime, im here on the ... line. Commmand line.
bookdb status

# list all of my horcruxes.
bookdb ls
```

Ok, that was the EZ PZ PART, as promised. Next comes the crazy stuff.



<br>

## üí´ Contexts & The Cursor

The most powerful feature of `bookdb` is its context-aware cursor. A **context chain** is a simple string that points to a specific namespace.

```
@<Project_Namespace>.VAR.<Key-Value_Namespace>
 \___________________/     \__________________/
          |                        |
     Top-level container     A sub-folder for
      (e.g., a project)       related variables
```

When you provide a context chain with a command (like in the Quick Start), `bookdb` does two things:
1.  Executes the command in that specific context.
2.  **Saves that context as your new active cursor.**

This means all future commands will run in that context by default, saving you from repetitive typing. You can always see your current context with `bookdb cursor`.


## Advanced Usage


### Advanced Exporting and Importing 

**Exporting**

```bash
  # Export all keystores from the 'GLOBAL' project only:
  for ks in $(bookdb ls vars @GLOBAL.VAR.MAIN); do
    bookdb export keystore @GLOBAL.VAR.$ks #automagically creates global_[ks].env
  done
```

**Importing**

```bash
  # Import these keys back to the databeez! Call them cool and make them global
  bookdb import global_coolkeys.env
```

**Migrate**



```bash
  # Start with the migrate cmd to create your full bookdb backup directory
  # usually called bookdb_fullback_NNNN/ zip it if you must!
  # Doll up the ducks darling we're driving to Denver.
  bookdb migrate
```
**Restore/Slurp**

Some advanced behaviors enabled by `bookdb` can be achieved by using composable/pipeable tools. For example, a mass restore function to slurp up a directory of env files into your keystores is easily done with grep, a for-loop, and an opposable thumb.

```bash
  # Restore previous bookdb state using backup files from a migrated folder.
  # Why do we have so many ducks?? 
  for file in bookdb_fullbak_*/; do bookdb import "\$file" -y; done
```

You already have all the power, you do not need more power! Is there more? Why yes!

----

### üî• Hot File Publishing (`pub`/`unpub`)

Aka the "why is my hair on fire?" Tool.

While `export` is great for dumping an entire keystore, `pub` and `unpub` are designed for managing individual lines in a configuration file (like `.env`). This keeps your configs perfectly in sync with `bookdb` as your single source of truth.

This is super advance dark magic of `sed`, there is no coming back from the doom you unleash using this power. Thank goodness for `SAFE_MODE` amiright? Well consider this DANGER_ZONE_MODE. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Safe mode does not *yet* apply to hot file context-chain publishing, but such a change *can* be rewounded __unless__ you clobbered a pre-existing variable! You *can* backup your own files before, eh, tinkering. Do not bring down the entirety of Cloudflare with this dark magic. (*Jots notes, adds to roadmap*)

>  BONUS EXCLUSIVE FOR CLOUDFLARE EMPLOYEES: This command comes with a FREE, invisible ghost that will follow you around and ask, 'Are you sure you meant to edit that production config?'

Great power, great responsibility. 

Behold the runes of yore:


```bash
# First, store a port number in bookdb
bookdb setv PORT=8080 @webapp.VAR.config

# Now, publish that specific key to your application's .env file.
# The context chain now includes the key itself.
bookdb pub @webapp.VAR.config.PORT ./webapp.env

# The file webapp.env now contains the line:
# PORT=8080

# Later, you decide to change the port. You only need to update bookdb.
bookdb setv PORT=9000 @webapp.VAR.config

# Re-run the same publish command to update the file.
bookdb pub @webapp.VAR.config.PORT ./webapp.env

# The file webapp.env is now intelligently updated to:
# PORT=9000

# To remove the key from the config file:
bookdb unpub @webapp.VAR.config.PORT ./webapp.env
```

> A wild Dev Ops appears.

> Book used pub, it was very effective.

----

## ü§ñ Scripting & Automation (Modes)

You can alter `bookdb`'s default behavior using environment variables, which is perfect for CI/CD pipelines or automated scripts. Set DEV_MODE or SAFE_MODE in your environment or by setting it ahead of the script call:

*   `DEV_MODE=true`: Bypasses all confirmation prompts (`[y/N]`). Equivalent to using the `-y` flag for every command.
    ```bash
    # This will completely reset the installation without asking for confirmation.
    DEV_MODE=true bookdb reset; #front loaded variable 
    ```
*   `SAFE_MODE=true`: Enables automatic daily backups (one backup per day per invocation on that day to be precise). Before the first destructive action of the day (like `del`, `reset`), `bookdb` will create a timestamped backup of the database file in `~/.local/share/bookdb/backups/`. 
    ```bash
    # This ensures a backup is made before the deletion occurs.
    SAFE_MODE=true bookdb delv CRITICAL_KEY; #front loaded variable 
    ```


## ‚ò†Ô∏è Uninstallation

### One liner.

`bookdb` is designed to be ~~fully~~ mostly rewindable. The `reset` command acts as a complete uninstaller. Easy peezy :

```bash
# Undo the did, and send bookdb off to oblivion.
bookdb reset; # -y if youre funky
```
After confirmation or a `-y` skip, it will:
*   Delete itself from `~/.local/bin/`. 
*   Delete all databases, configuration, and state files.
*   Clean up the `source` line from your shell profile.

Your system will be left in ~~the exact~~ a similar state as it was before `bookdb` was installed.

### Your User Data 

If you'd like to keep the data from your keystores for later use, you can use the backup utility to create a zip of all your bookdb-related data. Eh, be sure to do this before you nuke.
* `bookdb backup` 
* not to be confused with `bookdb migrate` which only backs up your transferable keystores. (*jots notes in roadmap section... hides notes*)

### The Final, Final Step

Stroy time: so, whenever your shell learns a new script it adds it to an internal cache and counts how many time you use it. Neat! However, when "uninstalling" a script via good ol' rimraf, the shell plays dumb and acts like it doesnt know what happened.

So in our case, if you try to run `bookdb` again, it will complain it doesnt exist... well duh, I deleted it. Right? Wrong.

You need to delete it from `hash`. And yes, `bookdb` would love to do this for your but it's ~~impossible~~ unfeasable. 

First, check the high scores by running `hash`.

Next, nuke the duke. You can do this one of two ways:

1. Clear the whole hash `hash -r`

2. Clear the specific hash `hash -d bookdb`


The clearing the ~hole~ whole is more effective if the ~~ladder~~ latter ever fails. This mostly applies if youre like me and strongly dislike restarting your finely handcrafted meatball flavored shell session.ü§å

And there you have it folks, *BashFX-compliant* full Rewind! *mic drop* üé§

<summary><strong>A Note on Philosophy: BASHFX</strong></summary>

`bookdb` is built according to a small set of principles called **BASHFX**, designed to make shell tools powerful without being rude. For you as a user, this means:

*   **Self-Contained:** All installation artifacts (the database, config files, etc.) live inside a single root directory: `~/.local`.
*   **Invisible:** `bookdb` will never create new dotfiles (`.bookdb`, etc.) in your `$HOME` directory. It keeps its mess in its own room.
*   **Rewindable:** The `install` command has a perfect opposite in the `reset` command. This ensures the tool can be completely and cleanly removed from your system, leaving no trace.
*   **Friendly:** The tool should be proactive in communicating its state. The interactive installer and commands like `status` and `cursor` are designed to keep you informed.

## ‚ÅâÔ∏èü§î Frequently Asked Questions
Or what I like to call, "an interpretive dance of mimes in text-only format."

* Q: **Why is this called BookDB if there are no books involved?**<br>
‚Æß A: Anything can be a book if you try hard enough.

* Q: **What are databeez?**<br>
‚Æß A: They are the beez that feed on your keyz. Dur! Feed them keys. Watch em cheez!

* Q: **Why do you hate Cloudflare?**<br>
‚Æß A: I don't, yet. They're welcome to send me flowers for no reason. Bzzz.

* Q: **Why did you make BookDB?**<br>
‚Æß A: Beaver + Spandex. See opening synopsis.

* Q: **You blew up my system! do you care?**<br>
‚Æß A: I did once.

* Q: **What is BashFX?**<br>
‚Æß A: Willy Wonka meets command line scripting, only less self-actualizing.

* Q: **Why cant you just follow the everybody standards?**<br>
‚Æß A: I am the standard creator.

* Q: **Why is this README so dumb?**<br>
‚Æß A: I dunno but the probablity parser gave me five stars. Probably got lost in the paradox. tsk tsk


* Q: **Question for you reader. Did you read this whole thing?**<br>
‚Æß A: If you did, then know this tool I made for me, is a gift to you.

## ü§î Why Use This?

* Cool people use this, like me. 
* You dislike all things SQL but appreciate well-meaning abstractions.
* You realize the power of regex, but your philonthropic leanings leave room for others to bang their head on the keyboard in your stead. 
* There's some wild to your child, but need more power in your flower.
* You have environs, and they need some mints. Managemints!
* You wanna see what this baby can do! *slaps the hood*

DO NOT USE THIS IF:

* You are not cool aka use zsh.
* You take metaphors literally.
* Have no idea what you're doing (cuz I dont either.)
* Are an employee at Cloudflare. JK! but dont use it in production. *side eye*


## Testing / Compatibility


  * `bookdb` passed **Phase I II III IV V** manual testing suites on a Debian-based distro. This is basically saying nothing of value to a zero-context reader. You might guess.
  
  * It is 95% **MVP-Compliant** with the BashFX Architecture v1.6. Meaning it works on my computer, but YMMV. 

  * Further testing is needed to ensure wider portability. Certain idioms like `sed` or `grep` may have OS-specific alternatives that arent currently used by bookdb.

## Roadmap / Todo

  * Probably Urgent
    * DANGER_ZONE_MODE fixes. Safety goggles for the kittens.
    * Ponder why or whether `migrate` supports transfering support files.
    * Ponder why `backup` functionally different than `migrate`.

  * Planned integration with the BashFX Framework.
    * Implement BashFX Standard Interface. 
    * Base refactor using BashFX `bootstrap` library.
    * Standard refactor using BashFX `stderr` library.
    * Compatibility refactor using BashFX `portable` library.
    * Options refactor using BashFX `stdopts` library.
    * Clean up manually integrated libraries.
    * Support BashFX `use_app` idiom. 

  * Additional Features.
    * Support read-only context-chains.
    * Support notes/journal namespace via the JRNL context-chain.
    * Support features/task namespace via the TASK context-chain.
    * Support bookmarks (integration with `markman` tool) via MARK context-chain.

  * Considerations.
    * Zsh support.
